# A Tour of Go (workshop)

Event: Golang Brno meetup #4  
URL: https://www.meetup.com/Golang-Brno/events/236846434/


## Abstract

Are you familiar with the official Go programming language documentation?

The https://tour.golang.org gives a great interactive introduction to the
language syntax and basic usage, and what could be more awesome than learning it
all with other peers and live guidance?

Writing tests and coding in Go with no fear!

In this workshop we will follow along the official tour, and then, as time
permits, will do a small coding dojo, where participants get a chance to
familiarize themselves with developing Go code with the aid of automated tests.

Requirements:

- a laptop with a recent Web browser (to visit https://tour.golang.org)
- no previous experience with Go required

Optional:

- if you feel like it, you can do the tour at home, and bring questions
- install Go on your laptop (won't be needed, but can be useful to bring
questions if you have trouble setting up a development environment)
