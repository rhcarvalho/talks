Event: Golang Brno meetup #1  
URL: http://www.meetup.com/Golang-Brno/events/230539056/

## Abstract

Everyone have their own reasons to love or hate a programming language. In this
opinionated talk I'll share what makes Go special for me, and what I miss the
most whenever I get to write code in a different language.  Expect to hear not
only about features but why they matter, and how they make Go unique and
special.
