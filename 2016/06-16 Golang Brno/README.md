# The Go features I can't live without, 2nd round

Event: Golang Brno meetup #2  
URL: http://www.meetup.com/Golang-Brno/events/231266490/

## Abstract

After talking about simplicity and other 7 traits of Go in the last meetup,
we'll follow up with more.

By now you know that Go "lack" features because, by design, it was meant to be a
simple to use language with orthogonal features. You also know that Go is
boring, and that's okay.

In this second round, I'll cover what else makes Go special for me, come ready
to ask questions. The topics can be found in the end of the previous
presentation: http://goo.gl/kpqSId.
