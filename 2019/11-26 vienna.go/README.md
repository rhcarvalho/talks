## Abstract

A personal tale on what makes Go unique.

Here I share a slice of what makes Go special for me, and what I miss the most
whenever I get to write code in a different language.  
Emphasis on how Go empowers us to communicate ideas about reality.

This is a "remake" of "The Go features I can't live without"
([part 1](../../2016/05-17%20Golang%20Brno) and
[part 2](../../2016/06-16%20Golang%20Brno)) from 2016.
